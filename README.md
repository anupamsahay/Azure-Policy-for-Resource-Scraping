Special Permissions:

Security Features:

Strictly read-only with explicit blocks on write/delete operations
No privilege escalation possible
DataActions included for reading blob/file contents when needed for analysis
Protected against authorization changes

Implementation Notes:

Replace {guid} with a unique GUID (use New-Guid in PowerShell)
Replace {subscription-id}, {resource-group-name}, and {management-group-id} with your actual values
Comments are included (lines starting with //) for clarity but should be removed before deployment as JSON doesn't support comments
The wildcard */read at the end ensures future service coverage

This policy enables comprehensive resource inspection capabilities needed for cost optimization tools, compliance checking, and resource consistency analysis while maintaining strict security boundaries.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
